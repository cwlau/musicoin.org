<h4>How it works?</h4>

<p>Firstly, Musicoin is an open ledger(we call it blockchain) maintained by global users to accommodate every musical works in the world. It can include different type of musical works, from musical score, lyrics to recordings. All the works will be traceable and immutable once it's released. We don't need any 3rd party, the blockchain itself becomes a global music repertoire for musical works and listening history.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Secondly, Musicoin defines a micro protocol called “Pay-Per-Play”(PPP). This protocol will assure a musical work released to blockhcain with a proper license. Once it's released, anyone wants to play the work(or sync, or perform), royalty will be charged and paid automatically. In this way, every playback in the world will be accounted. Other licenses related to music royalties will be possible to defined in similar way.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, listeners don't need to go to bank, or paypal, or using cash to pay for the usage. Instead, they can simply pay with a digital currency generated on the blockchain(it's where the the coins come from and distributed to the network). They discover, follow and tip their favorite musics and their creators like enchanting with their neighbors. Piracy? It won't exist any more because it's so easy to access songs rather costing to download from bittorent. To musicians, they don't need to wait for a Godot-like royalty check as well. PPP assure them they can get payment instantly once a playback happens in a corner of the world. Whatever types of musicians they are, they got their fan's support with real currency, not illusionary followers on social media.
</p>
<p>
The issuance of the coins will be following top cryptographic algorithms to ensure it's not being <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending" target="_blank">double-spending</a>, also follow a dedicate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply" target="_blank">monetary curve</a> based on economical needs. So Musicoin the currency and economic scale will be used to measure the whole music industry some years later.
</p>
<p>
Musicoin is designed for both musician and listeners, but will eventually benefit to the whole industry even traditional players. Old labels can put their copyrighted stuffs onto Musicoin blockchain and keep enjoying the upscaled consumption; entrepreneurs can build more innovative technologies and services to meet diversified demands from the network; Hardware makers can create tangible and wearable the same time smart gadgets to extend the glory of musical devices in our cultural legacy.
</p>
<p>
If some <a href="http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2015/06/29/recording-sales-would-be-17-times-higher-without-piracy-umg-study-finds/" target="_blank">researches</a> are correct, the only best way to make music industry great again is to innovate and change. We'd call musician and their appreciators all join this great transition, now!
